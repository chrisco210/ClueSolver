# ClueSolver
ClueSolver is a program to play the board game Clue.
It uses the z3 theorem prover to determine the contents of the case file based
on the guesses made in the game.  

The deductions used are based on [this assignment](http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~tneller/nsf/clue/).

You need to install the Java bindings for Z3 for this to work.  
Make sure you install after building the bindings.
